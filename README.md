## Paper Implementation
`Bing Liu`, `Wynne Hsu`, and `Yiming Ma`. 1998. Integrating classification and association rule mining. In Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD'98). AAAI Press, 80–86.

Two part Implementation:  
* Mining Class association rules     
* Building a classifier

## Datasets Used
* **``breast-w``** – Original Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database, from Dr Wolberg clinical cases.
* **`iris`** – Pattern recognition database containing 3 types of iris plants.
* **`pima-diabetes`** – Prediction of onset of diabetes, based on diagnostics
* **`heart`** – Cleveland database referring to the presence of heart disease in a patient.
* **`tic-tac-toe`** – Binary classification task on possible configurations of tic-tac-toe games.
* **`acute-inflammations (additional)`** – Presumptive diagnosis of two diseases in the urinary system.
* **`balance-scale (additional)`** – Psychological experiments based on a balance scale.

## Comparison with Other Classification Methods
* Random Forest
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Decision Tree
